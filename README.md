# Snake

Web implementations of a normal game of snake ([Snake 2D](https://hallo89.net/games/snake2D)) and a game of snake on three axes ([Snake 3D](https://hallo89.net/games/snake3D)).

This project is intended to be used in conjunction with [hallo89.net](https://github.com/hallo89/hallo89.net) (hence why it's using [Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) templates). It needs to be cloned or symlinked into the hallo89.net project root, after which it will work out of the box.
